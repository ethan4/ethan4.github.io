I first put on my green Vend shirt in January of 2013. **Boy does that feel like a long time ago.**

[Vend](http://vendhq.com) runs at a pretty intense pace so things are always changing — better ways to do things, new verticals, new technology. Since I started we have opened an office in Melbourne and then a few months later another in Toronto which I helped get off the ground, and with plans to open two more in the very near future this is showing no signs of slowing. We've added almost 100 employees and grown our base of retailers to more than 10,000 active users.

What hasn't changed is the way I feel about coming to work every day. The office is a good place to be and Vend still feels like a small group of talented people going after a really big fish. While we've got timezones to contend with now, the overall feeling is just the same — everyone knows everyone and this is of paramount importance. Information flows freely when conversation is easy and allowed, so if I need to talk to someone about a tricky issue or a topic I don't understand we can get down to the details instead of relaying mixed messages through managers or just not asking at all — information sharing is seen as a part of daily operation and not a burden to be avoided until the last minute.

Of course it's not all rainbows and unicorns, as with any workplace we are often presented hard problems to solve — there are always challenges in a workplace but what varies here is the dose.
